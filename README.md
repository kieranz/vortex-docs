## Documentation for Vortex

Go to the [Wiki](https://github.com/kieranz/vortex-docs/wiki) for Docs

#### Explanation

I honestly think that the Vortex language is interesting.  I came across it and found a .tex file, which I converted to a PDF and later converted to markdown.
The original PDF is here for anyone interested.
